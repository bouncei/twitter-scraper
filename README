# Twitter Scraper

This is a Twitter scraper built with Node.js that periodically checks the CoinDesk Twitter channel for new tweets containing videos or images. When a video is detected, an email notification is sent to the specified recipient. If an image is detected, it is saved to a PostgreSQL database via a REST API.
